The focus for this third edition has been to make an electronic version that
students can read on the tablets and laptops that they bring to
lectures.  The main changes from the second edition are:

\begin{itemize}\setlength{\itemsep}{-1pt}
\item Incorporated fixes for the errata discovered in the second edition.
\item Made e-book friendly by adding cross referencing links to document 
elements and formatted pages to fit on most small screen tablets (i.e., width
of margins minimized).
\item Limited material for University of Auckland's CompSci 220
currently taught topics.
Removed the two chapters on formal languages (Part III) and
truncated the book title.
